=============================
Deploy a cluster from scratch
=============================

CrateDB Cloud currently offers two different cloud providers: Microsoft Azure
and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our tutorials offer a full walkthrough for the
signup process for each of these.

Each tutorial is structured as follows. First, it covers the signup through the
platforms of the respective cloud provider. Via either route you then end up at
the CrateDB Cloud Console wizard, where you can configure the essentials: your
organization, project, and cluster. Finally, this process gains you access to
the CrateDB Cloud Console.

To proceed with either tutorial, choose the cloud provider that suits your
needs and follow the steps in the relevant section of the tutorial. Then, in
either case, follow the process outlined for configuring your cluster through
the CrateDB Cloud Console wizard.
