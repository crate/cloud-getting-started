=============================
Deploy a cluster from scratch
=============================

This tutorial explains how to get set up with CrateDB Cloud. It will walk you
through the signup as well as the configuration.

CrateDB Cloud currently offers two different cloud providers: Microsoft Azure
and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This tutorial is a full walkthrough for the
signup process. First, it covers the signup through the platforms of each of
these providers: Azure Marketplace and AWS Marketplace, respectively. Via
either route you then end up at the CrateDB Cloud Console wizard, where you can
configure the essentials of your organization, project, and cluster and gain
access to the CrateDB Cloud Console. Since the wizard looks slightly
differently depending on your choice of cloud provider, there are also two
separate configuration pages in the tutorial, one for each provider.

To proceed with the tutorial, choose a cloud provider that suits your needs and
follow the steps in the relevant section of the tutorial. Then, in either case,
follow the process outlined for configuring your cluster through the CrateDB
Cloud Console wizard.
