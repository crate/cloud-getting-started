`CrateDB Cloud`_ is a fully-managed version of `CrateDB`_, offered as a service
that is based in the cloud and is run by the experts at `Crate.io`_. CrateDB
Cloud supports data storage, real-time analytics, and visualization at scale,
specialized for the *Industrial Internet of Things* (IIoT).

  signing up through spinning up your first cluster on CrateDB Cloud.

    These are beginner tutorials.

    advanced information.
