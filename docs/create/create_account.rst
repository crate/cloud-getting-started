Create a CrateDB Cloud user account
===================================

To use CrateDB Cloud, you need a CrateDB Cloud user account.

To sign up for a new account, fill in the form on our
`CrateDB Cloud signup page`_.

<SCREENSHOT from safari>

Once you've filled in your information, select *Sign up*.

Shortly after, you should receive a confirmation e-mail that includes your
six-digit verification code.

Copy your verification code from the e-mail and paste it into the text input
field on the signup page.

Select *Confirm*, to complete your new CeateDB Cloud user account.

You should now see the CrateDB Cloud Console.

If so, then you're already logged in to your account.

You have successfully created your CrateDB user account.

Next steps
==========

Now that your CrateDB Cloud user account is ready, you can continue by:

* `Installing the Croud CLI`_ to interact with CrateDB Cloud using the command line
  interface (currently recommended) or
* by `Working with the Cloud Console`_ to interact with CrateDB Cloud
